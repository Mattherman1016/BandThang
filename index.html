<h3>matt</h3>
<p>
Matt was born on the side the road and adopted by a family of mongooses (mongees). All he had was his grit and a deep love for ambient funk. Over the years, he learned how to hunt, gather food and play the altered scale. He developed a deep appreciation for Jerkob Colliflower, Spanky Purpey, and VolfPerks and decided to take on massive debt to persue his passion for music.

chris is in charge of tickling the ivories on this funk journey. he hammers both piano strings and heart strings alike. he is deathly allergic to peanuts so please refrain from bringing peanuts or peanut-containing products to shows and events. thank you.
